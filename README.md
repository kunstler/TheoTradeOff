=======

## Georges Kunstler <georges.kunstler@gmail.com>

A R package to run cellular automaton simulation of tree community assembly with species defined by three parameters early successional competitive ability, late successional competitive ability and abiotic stress tolerance.

The core code is in C++ via Rcpp.

TODO provide a propoper description.
